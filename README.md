# Algorithms

> Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!
> \- [Joe Armstrong](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)>)

> For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing.
> \- [Francis Sullivan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COT4401/notes/cise_v2_i1/editors.pdf)

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.
> \- [Donald Knuth](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/726152-an-algorithm-must-be-seen-to-be-believed)

> I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
> \- [Linus Torvalds](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6636783-i-will-in-fact-claim-that-the-difference-between-a)
